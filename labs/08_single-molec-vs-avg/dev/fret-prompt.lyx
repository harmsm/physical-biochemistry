\begin_layout Standard
You are studying a member of the Guanylate Kinase family.
 As part of its enzymatic cycle, two

\end_inset

 open and close.
 (It is active when closed, but must be open to bind substrate and release
 product).
 You design an inhibitor and want to understand which structure it binds
 to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You use a technique called FRET (FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer), which
 lets you measure an apparent distance between two fluorophores (the stars
 in the picture).
 You excite one flourophore (say, green star) but not the other (say purple
 star).
 If you choose your fluorophores wisely, the emission from the green fluorophore
 will excite the purple fluorophore.
 This means you can excite green, but observe emssion on purple.
 One can measure the FRET efficiency (
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

), which is basically how well energy is transferred from the first to the
 second fluorophore.
 This can be related to distance by the following:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E=\frac{1}{1+(r/R_{0})^{6}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the distance between the fluorophores and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{0}$
\end_inset

 depends on the fluorophores chosen.
 Some fluorphores transfer efficiently only at short range, others have
 very long range.
 Thus, y choosing specific dye pairs, one can build an assay that is sensitive
 to specific distance changes.

\begin_layout Enumerate
You measure the total fluorescence change for a cuvette containing billions
 of molecules.
 You measure an apparent distance of 7.5 nm in the absence of the drug, and
 5.0 nm in the presence of the drug.
 Come up with a mechanistic model for what is happening when the drug binds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You repeat this experiment using TIRF microscopy, which lets you measure
 the apparent distance between lobes for individual molecules.
 You make 2,000 single-molecule measurements in the abscence of the drug,
 and 2,000 more measurements in the presence of the drug.
 Download the Excel spreadsheet containing these data.
 (Each group will be assigned a different spreadsheet).
