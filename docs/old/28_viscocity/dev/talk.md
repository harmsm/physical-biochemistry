At cellular length scales, random walks dominate motion.

Movement of large protein structure stops when growth stops
![sm.video](mov-s1.mp4) height="50%" width="50%" controls
>>>
Large protein with GFP tag randomly wanders around the cell
![sm.video](mov-s2.mp4) height="50%" width="50%" controls
>>>
This stops after carbon starvation
![sm.video](mov-s3.mp4) height="50%" width="50%" controls
>>>
Maybe this is something to do with the starvation response?
>>>
No: the same thing is seen with addition of DNP (rapidly stopping oxidative phosphorylation) in growing cells
![sm.video](mov-s4.mp4) height="50%" width="50%" controls
>>>
All three scenarios give a similar quantaitive responses

![sm.image](fig-1b.png)
>>>
Maybe it is something specific about this protein?
>>>
No: like the protein, a plasmid randomly moves throughout the cell under growth conditions
![sm.video](mov-s5.mp4) height="50%" width="50%" controls
>>>
Addition of DNP stops plasmid movement
![sm.video](mov-s6.mp4) height="50%" width="50%" controls

Maybe it is an evolutionary adaptation of bacterial components? 
>>>
No: the same behavior is seen for a foreign, viral particle

It appears that movement in the bacterial cytoplasm depends on metabolic activity. 
<div class="fragment"><em>This is weird.</em></div>
>>>
From the authors:

<small>The observation that the motion of cytoplasmic components depends on metabolic activity was surprising, as it appeared inconsistent with diffusion, which is a passive process.</small>
>>>
So what is it?  Maybe it's chromosome related? (Open DNA leading to altered dyamics).
>>>
No: a mutant that clumps chromosomes (leaving open space in cell) looks the same.
![sm.image](fig-2b-e.png)
>>>
Dynamics are almost indistinguishable in open-space mutant

![sm.image](fig-2f-g.png)
>>>
Maybe it's a specific motor protein?  
>>>
No: adding drugs disrupting bacterial homologs of actin, tubulin, RNA polymerase, and ribosomes had no effect on motion.

>>>
What the heck is going on?
>>>
Observation: particles still move with DNP, they just don't take long steps any more.

![sm.image](fig-2f-g.png)
>>>
What if we try different particle sizes?
>>>
Smaller particles (smaller bin) diffuse faster than large particles, even with DNP

![sm.image](fig-3a-b.png)
>>>
Diffusion of smaller particles changes <em>less</em> than larger particles

![sm.image](fig-3c.png)
>>>
Diffusion of smaller particles changes <em>less</em> than larger particles

![sm.image](fig-3d-e.png)
>>>
Larger particles appear <em>trapped</em> (non-ergodic).

![sm.image](fig-4c-e.png)
>>>
This would behave if the cytoplasm became a glass.

Prediction: glasses always exhibit two or more dynamic regimes. 
>>>
Particles are found in either a slow or fast regime -- it looks like a glass!

>>>
Turning off metabolism locally traps large particles.

Conclusions:
+ For particles larger than 30 nm, bacterial cytoplasm is <em>not</em> a viscous fluid
+ Metabolism "fluidizes" the cytoplasm!
>>>
How does the fluidization occur?
+ Protein dis-aggregation? (Munder et al (2015) eLife)
+ Volume increase? (Joyner et al. (2016) eLife)
+ Chemically propelled proteins? (Dey & Sen (2017) JACS)
+ Phase transitions? (Bangwynne et al (2015) Nature Physics)
+ ...?
