#### Statistical mechanics primer

October 1, 2018
>>>
Goal: Prime thinking about free energy and statistical mechanics.  

(We are going to develop these ideas more rigorously over the next two weeks). 
>>>
#### Task:
Calculate $\Delta G$, $\Delta H$, and $\Delta S$ for forming a +/- bond

#### Assumptions
1. Isolated system.
2. Entropy and enthalpy changes soley due to chain (e.g. no solvent). 
3. Only moves are single bond rotations.
4. On average, it takes 5 times longer for a "+/- together" microstate to flip 
   to a "+- separated" microstate than to go the other way.
