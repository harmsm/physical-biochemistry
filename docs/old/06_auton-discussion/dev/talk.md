+ Adenylate kinases are enzymes that catalyze the 
  interconversion of ATP, ADP, and AMP.
+ They are critical regulatory molecues that maintain ATP homeostasis.
+ There functional cycle is like a clamshell. When open, a substrate can dock.  
  The clamshell then closes, bringing the active site residues into position.

You want to design a competitive inhibitor of this enzyme. 
+ Brainstorm a list of the factors you must consider when designing
  such a drug. 
+ How would you model/calculate/estimate the contribution of each of these 
  factors in the design process?

Simple models can (sometimes) give you quantitative understanding of 
biomolecular function.
