Syllabus: CH465/565 Physical Biochemistry (Winter 2022)
-------------------------------------------------------

Course Description
------------------
This course focuses on the thermodynamics, kinetics, and molecular structure
that allow us to understand the molecular basis of biological processes. The
course is intended to provide you with an intellectual framework for
understanding the behavior of biological macromolecules in terms of their
physics.

Class structure:
================

The class meets Monday and Wednesday from 14:00 to 14:50 in 101 VOL.  It meets
Friday 14:00-15:20 in B042 PSC.

Textbook
========
*The Molecules of Life: Physical and Chemical Principles.* John Kuriyan,
Boyana Konforti, and David Wemmer. This textbook is *not* required, but I do
provide reading that can help amplify the course material. You will not be
required to know any material from the book that is not covered in class. I will
also post links to helpful reading material on the main course schedule.

Students should also consult additional material as necessary (including other
sections in *The Molecules of Life*) and are encouraged to search the primary
scientific literature for more information (e.g. through pubmed or Google
scholar). If you are having trouble finding additional information on a topic,
please let me know. Other textbooks that may be useful include:

- *Biological Physics.* Philip Nelson.
- *Molecular and Cellular Biophysics.* Meyer P. Jackson.
- *Principles of Physical Biochemisty.* Kensal van Holde, Curtis Johnson and
  Shing Ho.

Grading
=======

There are three ways in which to earn points in the class.  Grades will be
assigned on the basis of the total number of points acquired over the course of
the term.

- Class attendance (25% of points)
- Homework sets (25% of points)
- Summative Assessment (50% of points)

On the first day of class, we will discuss how you would like to do summative
assessment: midterm and final, projects, presentations, or something else.

Letter grades: Letter grades will be determined based on total points, not on
individual exams and assignments. Getting >90% of the points guarantees an A;
>80%, B; >70%, C; and >60%, D. In the event that scores are skewed downward, the
final scores will be curved with breaks between each bin determined by “jumps”
in the grade data that separate groups of students. This curve is designed so
that it can only help you. If the entire class receives >90%, every student
would receive an A.

Graduate students and undergraduates will be graded on different curves.

Homework
========

There are seven homework sets, due at the beginning of class on Fridays as
noted on the schedule. These can be turned in electronically on canvas or
physically in class. 

Community
=========

This class is governed by the UO community standards.

- Respect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals.
- Promote a culture of respect.
- Respect the privacy, property, and freedom of others.
- Reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any kind.
- Practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from others.
- Full standards available at https://dos.uoregon.edu/social-misconduct.

Students with Disabilities: If you have a documented disability and anticipate
needing accommodations in this course, please make arrangements to meet with
Mike soon. Please bring a notification letter from the Accessible Education Center
(http://aec.uoregon.edu/) outlining your approved accommodations.

Cheating: TL;DR: Don’t do it. You are expected to do your own work. Cheating,
plagiarism and any other form of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.
Please refer to the University Of Oregon Student Conduct Code (see
https://dos.uoregon.edu/academic-misconduct) by which all students are expected
to abide. Should you be found guilty of academic dishonesty, you will receive 0
points for the exam or assignment in question. A second infraction will result
in an F and expulsion from the course.
