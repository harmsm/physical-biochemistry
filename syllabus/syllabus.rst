Syllabus: CH465/565 Physical Biochemistry (2018)
------------------------------------------------

Course Description
------------------
This course focuses on the thermodynamics, kinetics, and molecular structure
that allow us to understand the molecular basis of biological processes. The
course is intended to provide you with an intellectual framework for
understanding the behavior of biological macromolecules in terms of their
physics.

Office Hours: By request

Class structure:
================

The class meets Monday and Wednesday from 10:00 to 10:50.  It meets Friday
from 9:00 to 10:50.  All class sessions are in Onyx 171.

Textbook
========
*The Molecules of Life: Physical and Chemical Principles.* John Kuriyan,
Boyana Konforti, and David Wemmer.

One copy of this book will be on reserve in the library. Much of the material
that we cover in class will be in *The Molecules of Life*. You will not be
required to know any material from the book that is not covered in class
(unless it was covered in CH461). The reading assignments listed below are
guidelines of sections you may consult to understand the material in class.
Students should also consult additional material as necessary (including other
sections in *The Molecules of Life*) and are encouraged to search the primary
scientific literature for more information (e.g. through pubmed or Google
scholar). If you are having trouble finding additional information on a topic,
please let me know. Other textbooks that may be useful include:

- *Biological Physics.* Philip Nelson.
- *Molecular and Cellular Biophysics.* Meyer P. Jackson.
- *Physical Chemistry: Principles and Applications in the Life Sciences.*
  Tinoco, Sauer, Wang, Puglisi, Harbison, and Rovnyak.
- *Principles of Physical Biochemisty.* Kensal van Holde, Curtis Johnson and
  Shing Ho.

Course Prerequisites
====================

- CH461. Students will need to remember amino acid structures and understand
  the basic concepts behind the thermodynamic principles that govern the
  stability of macromolecules and their interactions. While some time will
  be devoted to reviewing material in CH461, students with holes in their
  foundational understanding of biochemistry will have to review key concepts
  using one of the biochemistry text books listed below.

Grading
=======

There are four ways in which to earn points in the class.  Grades will be
assigned on the basis of the total number of points acquired over the course of
the term.

- Class attendance (25% of points)
- Homework sets (25% of points)
- Midterm (20% of points)
- Final (30% of points)

Letter grades: Letter grades will be determined based on total points, not on
individual exams and assignments. Getting >90% of the points guarantees an A;
>80%, B; >70%, C; and >60%, D. In the event that scores are skewed downward, the
final scores will be curved with breaks between each bin determined by “jumps”
in the grade data that separate groups of students. This curve is designed so
that it can only help you. If the entire class receives >90%, every student
would receive an A.

Graduate students and undergraduates will be graded on different curves.

Community
=========

This class is governed by the UO community standards.

- Respect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals.
- Promote a culture of respect.
- Respect the privacy, property, and freedom of others.
- Reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any kind.
- Practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from others.
- Full standards available `here https://dos.uoregon.edu/social-misconduct`_.

Students with Disabilities: If you have a documented disability and anticipate
needing accommodations in this course, please make arrangements to meet with
Mike soon. Please bring a notification letter from the `Accessible Education Center http://aec.uoregon.edu/`_)
outlining your approved accommodations.

Cheating: TL;DR: Don’t do it. You are expected to do your own work. Cheating,
plagiarism and any other form of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.
Please refer to the `University Of Oregon Student Conduct Code https://dos.uoregon.edu/academic-misconduct`_
by which all students are expected to abide. Should you be found guilty of
academic dishonesty, you will receive 0 points for the exam or assignment in
question. A second infraction will result in an F and expulsion from the course.
