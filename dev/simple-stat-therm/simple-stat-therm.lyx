The time-average structure [of a protein] observed by X-ray diffraction
 is something of an abstraction, since it is not itself widely—or even sparsely—
represented at any given time in the population of molecules.
 I mean by this that if we were to take an instantaneous picture of the
 molecular population showing us all the coordinates of the atoms for each
 individual molecule we would have difficulty in finding one that will match
 the average in

 When thinking about molecular motion, we should picture a mosh pit rather

 Whatever amazing function they accomplish has to overcome (or utilize!)
 this inescapable randomness.

Whatever biochemical mechanisms we come up with must take this into account.

Fortunately, we have powerful theoretical, computational, and experimental
 tools for understanding biomolecules from a statistical perspective.
 Unfortunately, even foundational concepts in this discipline can be difficult
 to grasp.
 Although students encounter words like 
\emph on
entropy
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
enthalpy
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
heat
\emph default
 in first-year general chemistry, the deep meaning of these words is often
 elusive.
 This is, in part, because understanding these terms requires mastering
 ideas from statistical physics—a nontrival task for a physics student,
 much less a molecular biologist.

But physicists aren't the only scientists who deal in the mechanisms of
 biomolecules.
 Biochemists, cell biologists, molecular biologists, and geneticists must
 often evoke a molecular explanation to answer questions in their field.
 How can such scientists develop statistical and molecular intuition for
 these problems without being overhelmed by statistical physics? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is one attempt to answer this question.
 We will attempt to develop a framework for non-physicists to think about
 biomolecules in statistical thermodynamic terms.
 We will use very simple models to explore key ideas in statistical thermodynami
cs.
 The framework we develop will remain imprecise.
 We will develop math to describe something specific—like dice, or toy protein
 models—and then baldly assert the result is general.
 The goal is to provide a flavor for such approaches, without getting bogged
 down in details.
 While rigor is important, it can also interfere with intelligibility, particula
rly for the non-specialist.

This document is no replacement of one of the excellent textbooks that delve
 into physical biochemistry.
 Hopefully the simple examples we discuss can whet your appetite to dive

The Dice Folding Reaction:

\begin_layout Standard
For chemical reactions, we're often interested in questions like: 
\emph on
What direction is favored? 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
How fast will the reaction occur? 
\emph default
To explore these questions, we will start with something we'll call the
 Dice Folding Reaction (DFR).
 Imagine a large number of six-sided dice.
 These are all 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

molecules
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 that can each be in one of six different 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This is analagous to a protein folding reaction in which there is an unfolded

 We use 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\ll1$
\end_inset

 to avoid the complexity of rolling the same dice twice in one turn.
 Imagine for a second that we selected 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>1$
\end_inset

.
 This would mean that at least one dice gets rolled more than once in a
 turn.
 This can be dealt with, but makes the dynamics more complicated.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is small, the odds of hitting the same dice over 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 are small and can be neglected.
 In terms of chemistry, a small 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

means we are taking very small time steps, so not much can happen per step.

Remember, our goal is to use the DFR to ask questions about which direction

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{N_{other\rightarrow\epsdice{6}}}{\Delta t}=\alpha\cdot\left(N-N_{\epsdice{6}}\right)\cdot p_{\epsdice{6}}.\label{eq:rsix}

Hopefully you came to something like this: The average number of new 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 after a step is determined by 1) how many dice we rolled that could become
 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 and 2) the probability each becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

.
 The number of dice that can become 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 is determined by what fraction of all dice we rolled (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{5}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $N-N_{\epsdice{6}}$
\end_inset

).
 The probability a each yields 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\epsdice{6}}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What about the number of dice that start as 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 but are lost after a step? We can model this by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\text{\ensuremath{\frac{\ensuremath{N_{\epsdice{6}\rightarrow other}}}{\Delta t}}}=\alpha\cdot N_{\epsdice{6}}\cdot\left(1-p_{\epsdice{6}}\right)\label{eq:runsix}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is directly analgous to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 gain case.
 The number of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 lost per step is determined by the fraction of the dice we rolled (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

), how many dice were 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\epsdice{6}}$

), and the probability that each roll ends up as different than 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$

 (

 dice, 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 of which are 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 Our dice are fair (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\epsdice{6}}=1/6$

 of the dice.
 Because

 are at a frequency of 
\begin_inset Formula $5/30=1/6$
\end_inset

 already, the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 we expect to be gain matches the number we expect to lose.
 We then take a time step, selecting 10 dice and rolling them.
 In this example, one dice started 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{2}$
\end_inset

 and remained 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{2}$
\end_inset

 (gray); six dice started as something besides

 So, for this move, we gained two

 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1/3$

\begin_layout Subsection
A quick aside on how to cheat at dice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before moving on, let's pause to make sure we understand what 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\epsdice{6}}$
\end_inset

 means.
 (This will come in handy later).
 When we roll a dice, it can come up in one of six ways.
 With this in mind, a very general way to write 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\epsdice{6}}$
\end_inset

 is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{\epsdice{6}}=\frac{w_{6}}{\sum_{i=1}^{i\le6}w_{i}}\label{eq:psix}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\emph on
weight 
\emph default
given to a face on the dice.
 The sum on the bottom (
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{i\le6}w_{i}$
\end_inset

) is the 
\emph on
normalization factor
\emph default
.
 It describes the total the likelihood of a roll giving
\emph on
 
\emph default
all faces, allowing us to determine the relative probability of each specific
 face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a dice is fair, all faces have the same weight:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{\epsdice{6}}=\frac{1}{1+1+1+1+1+1}=\frac{1}{6}\approx0.167
\]

\end_inset

Note we could assign any weight we wanted, as long as it was the same for
 all faces:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{\epsdice{6}}=\frac{0.001}{0.001+0.001+0.001+0.001+0.001+0.001}=\frac{0.001}{0.006}\approx0.167
\]

\end_inset

If we want to bias our results to get more 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

, we could put more weight on that face.
 What if put a weight of 10 on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 face, while setting the weight on every other face to 1? 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{\epsdice{6}}=\frac{10}{1+1+1+1+1+10}=\frac{10}{15}\approx0.667
\]

\end_inset

We could even imagine an exotic dice where every face had a different weight.
 For example, imagine a dice weighted such that every face had the same
 weight as its numerical value.
 In that case: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{\epsdice{6}}=\frac{6}{1+2+3+4+5+6}=\frac{6}{21}\approx0.286
\]

\end_inset

Finally, if we want to know the probability of a 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{1}$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
or 
\emph default
a 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

, we could write:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{\epsdice{1}}+p_{\epsdice{6}}=\frac{w_{1}}{\sum_{i=1}^{i\le6}w_{i}}+\frac{w_{6}}{\sum_{i=1}^{i\le6}w_{i}}=\frac{w_{1}+w_{6}}{\sum_{i=1}^{i\le6}w_{i}}
\]

\end_inset

We can summarize our brief tangent as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

can be any (positive) number for each face.

We can make a couple of observations from these simulations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Reactions become more predictable as the number of molecules increases.

\series default
 As the number of dice increase, the curves become smoother.
 Hopefully, this is intuitive.
 Because dice rolling is a random process, it takes a large number of dice
 to average out all of the fluctuations.
 When we have only 
\begin_inset Formula $20$
\end_inset

 dice, the fraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 fluctuates up and down because even one low-probability roll has a huge
 effect on the outcome.
 When we have 
\begin_inset Formula $2,000$
\end_inset

 dice, the fraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 is robust to a few low probability events, simply because there are so
 many dice that we average over.
 In chemical reactions, we usually have millions and millions of molecules,
 making the reaction dynamics quite predictably.
 (Intriguingly, this is 
\emph on
not 
\emph default
always true in a cell, were the number of reactants can sometimes involve
 only tens of molecules.
 A cell might have only ten copies of a transcription factor.
 This leads to 
\emph on

—a fascinating topic we will not cover, but that is worth reading about).

Reactions converge to equilibrium whatever their starting conditions.

 No matter how many 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 we with start with, the simulations appear to converge on 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\epsdice{6}}N$
\end_inset

.
 If we pause for a moment, this is fairly remarkable.
 We have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reaction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that has a direction, without a single interaction or bond.
 It even obeys Le Chatelier's principle: if we add more reactants the reaction
 favors the product (green curve).
 If we make the reaction all product, some fraction of the molecules are
 eventually converted back to reactants (orange curve).
 Why does the reaction converge? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observation #2 is particularly important.
 We will present two (complementary) views that describe why the reaction
 converges: kinetics and thermodynamics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
A kinetic explanation for convergence to equilibrium:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to think about why this reaction converges is to consider the rates
 of the forward and reverse reactions (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:roll-convergence"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Imagine we start with a collection of dice that are all 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

.
 At each step, we pick up a single dice and roll it.
 For the first step, we can only pick up 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

; when we roll it, there is a 
\begin_inset Formula $5/6$
\end_inset

 chance we end up with something besides 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

.
 This means that the most probable outcome of that first roll is to lower
 the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:roll-convergence"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 For the first few rolls, we will still have more 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 than other numbers, so we will continue to favor rolls that lower the number
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

.
 As we continue to roll dice, however, the number of non-
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 dice will increase, eventually allowing transitions from non-
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 back to 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, after enough time, the rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 loss and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 gain offset offset, leading to the equilibrium value of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\epsdice{6}}$

 This bias away from

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can start by writing out a differential equation: the change in the number
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 is given by how many appear at each time step, less the number that are
 lost.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dN_{six}}{dt}=\frac{N_{other\rightarrow\epsdice{6}}}{dt}-\text{\ensuremath{\frac{\ensuremath{N_{\epsdice{6}\rightarrow other}}}{dt}}}
\]

\end_inset

Substitute equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 above and simplify:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dN_{\epsdice{6}}}{dt}=\alpha\cdot\left(N-N_{\epsdice{6}}\right)\cdot p_{\epsdice{6}}-\alpha\cdot N_{\epsdice{6}}\cdot\left(1-p_{\epsdice{6}}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dN_{\epsdice{6}}}{dt}=\alpha\left(p_{\epsdice{6}}N-p_{\epsdice{6}}N_{\epsdice{6}}-N_{\epsdice{6}}+p_{\epsdice{6}}N_{\epsdice{6}}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dN_{\epsdice{6}}}{dt}=\alpha\left(p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Rearrange so the 
\begin_inset Formula $dN_{\epsdice{6}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 terms are on opposite sides of the equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dN_{\epsdice{6}}=\alpha\left(p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6}}\right)dt
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6}}}dN_{\epsdice{6}}=\alpha dt

\end_inset

Integrate both sides:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int\frac{1}{p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6}}}dN_{\epsdice{6}}=\int\alpha dt
\]

\end_inset

Yielding:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-ln\left(p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6}}\right)=\alpha t+C

\end_inset

To figure out 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

, plug in values we know.
 In this case, we know that at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

, we have some initial number of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\epsdice{6},0}$

 (This is known as a boundary condition).
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-ln\left(p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6},0}\right)=\text{\ensuremath{\alpha}\ensuremath{\cdot}}0+C
\]

\end_inset

Once we know 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

, do some algebra to solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\epsdice{6}}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-ln\left(p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6}}\right)=\alpha t-ln\left(p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6},0}\right)

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-ln\left(p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6}}\right)+ln\left(p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6},0}\right)=\alpha t
\]

\end_inset

Use the rule 
\begin_inset Formula $log(a)-log(b)=log(a/b)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-ln\left(\frac{p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6}}}{p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6},0}}\right)=\alpha t

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{p_{\epsdice{6}ix}N-N_{\epsdice{6}}}{p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6},0}}=e^{-\alpha t}

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6}}=\left(p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6},0}\right)e^{-\alpha t}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N_{\epsdice{6}}=p_{\epsdice{6}}N-\left(p_{\epsdice{6}}N-N_{\epsdice{6},0}\right)e^{-\alpha t}

\end_inset

Simplify:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N_{\epsdice{6}}=p_{\epsdice{6}}N-p_{\epsdice{6}}Ne^{-\alpha t}+N_{\epsdice{6},0}e^{-\alpha t}

 What happens as

 When our dice reach this special concentration,

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$

 formation precisely offsets the rate of

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Standard
So how do these models for dice relate to real chemistry? In a chemistry
 text book, you'll find that a first-order rate constant looks something
 like this:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d[product]}{dt}=k\cdot[reactant]
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is a 
\emph on
rate constant
\emph default
, 
\begin_inset Formula $[product]$
\end_inset

 is the concentration of product and 
\begin_inset Formula $[reactant]$
\end_inset

 is the concentration of reactant.
 It turns out, we already wrote discrete versions of this:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{N_{other\rightarrow\epsdice{6}}}{\Delta t}=\alpha\cdot\left(N-N_{\epsdice{6}}\right)\cdot p_{\epsdice{6}}.
\]

\end_inset

In our discrete system with unimolecular reactions, 
\begin_inset Formula $N-N_{\epsdice{6}}$
\end_inset

 is operating like a concentration (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how many non-
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 are available to react?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 This means that the rate constant for the reaction is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{other\rightarrow\epsdice{6}}=\alpha\cdot p_{\epsdice{6}}.
\]

\end_inset

Our rate constant has two basic chunks: how many tries you make per turn
 (remember, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the fraction of the dice we pick up and roll on a turn) and the probability
 a reaction occurs per try (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\epsdice{6}}$
\end_inset

).
 We will revisit it when we discuss the

\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a prefactor that controls how often a reaction samples (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 This is analogous to 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 The other term,

How about equilibrium constants? Can we understand what they mean in terms
 of the dice reaction? You have probably seen that, for a two-state reaction,
 you can write:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K_{eq}=\frac{k_{forward}}{k_{reverse}}
\]

\end_inset

We already have 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{forward}$
\end_inset

 from above (
\begin_inset Formula $k_{other\rightarrow\epsdice{6}}$
\end_inset

).
 By analogy:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{reverse}=k_{\epsdice{6}\rightarrow other}=\alpha\cdot\left(1-p_{\epsdice{6}}\right).
\]

\end_inset

If we substitute this into the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{eq}$
\end_inset

 above, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{k_{forward}}{k_{reverse}}=\frac{\cancel{\alpha}p_{\epsdice{6}}}{\cancel{\alpha}(1-p_{\epsdice{6}})}=\frac{p_{\epsdice{6}}}{1-p_{\epsdice{6}}}.
\]

\end_inset

You have also probably seen that:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K_{eq}=\frac{[products]}{[reactants]}.
\]

\end_inset

Can we get there with the DFR? From our rate law, we found that the final
 concentration of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 was 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\epsdice{6}}N$
\end_inset

.
 If we substitute this into our equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{eq}$
\end_inset

 above, we get:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K_{eq}=\frac{N_{\epsdice{6}}}{N-N_{\epsdice{6}}}=\frac{p_{\epsdice{6}}N}{N-p_{\epsdice{6}}N}=\frac{p_{\epsdice{6}}}{1-p_{\epsdice{6}}}.

 constants and equilibrium constants mean.

We'll start with a simple, preliminary argument.
 Imagine we start with a collection of random dice and start rolling.
 What's the probability we end up with all

 at some point? Hopefully it is intuitive that there are many more ways
 to be something besides all 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$

 than to be all 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 If we have two dice, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

 possibilities for the first dice, and 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

 possibilities for the second dice.
 This means we have 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times6=36$
\end_inset

 different ways to arrange the dice.
 Since there is only one way to get 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

, the probability of seeing 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/36\approx0.03$
\end_inset

.
 The scaling relationship for the number of possible arrangements of the
 dice goes by 
\begin_inset Formula $6^{N_{dice}}$
\end_inset

 This means that even for four dice, there is only a 
\begin_inset Formula $1/1,296$
\end_inset

 chance of getting four 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 by chance.
 By the time we hit

\end_inset

 dice, the odds of getting 
\begin_inset Formula $100\ \epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 are absurdly low:

This, at its core, is the meaning of 
\emph on
entropy
\emph default
.
 Systems end up in populating states with the most configurations associated
 with it.
 Since there are vastly more ways to end up as something besides all-
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 than all-
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

—just as there are vastly more ways to have a losing lottery number than
 a winning lottery number—it is essentially impossible 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Equilibrium balances probable outcomes against outcomes that can happen
 in many ways 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This argument lets us understand why we do not see something extreme like
 all 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

, but not why we end up at the equilibrium value of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\epsdice{6}}$
\end_inset

.
 To do this, we need a general expression for calculating the probability
 of combinations of rolls.
 To get that, we're going to need to recall two basic rules from probability:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ANDs MULTIPLY.
 If you have two independent events—like rolling 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 on one dice AND rolling 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{1}$
\end_inset

 on a second dice—the probability of both events occuring is the 
\emph on
product
\emph default
 of the probabilities of each independent event (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\epsdice{6}}\times p_{\epsdice{1}}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ORs ADD.
 If you have two mutually exclusive events—like rolling a 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 OR rolling a 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{1}$
\end_inset

 on the same dice—the probability of seeing one or the other is the 
\emph on
sum 
\emph default
of the two probabilities (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\epsdice{6}}+p_{\epsdice{1}}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's develop our formula by asking what the probability of seeing exactly
 one 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 when rolling three dice is.
 We could roll 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 first and then roll something besides 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 twice.
 Since the dice are independent, the probability of this series of events
 is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{\epsdice{6}}\times(1-p_{\epsdice{6}})\times(1-p_{\epsdice{6}}).
\]

\end_inset

We could also roll something beside 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 first, roll 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 second, and then roll something beside 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 third:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(1-p_{\epsdice{6}})\times p_{\epsdice{6}}\times(1-p_{\epsdice{6}}).
\]

\end_inset

Or, finally, we could roll something beside 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 twice and then roll 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 third:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(1-p_{\epsdice{6}})\times(1-p_{\epsdice{6}})\times p_{\epsdice{6}}.
\]

\end_inset

These series of events are mutually exclusive: if we only saw one 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 in three rolls, we either saw the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 first, second, or third.
 The total probability of seeing one 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 is thus the sum of the probabilities of these exclusive series of events:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{one\times\epsdice{6}}=p_{\epsdice{6}}\times(1-p_{\epsdice{6}})\times(1-p_{\epsdice{6}})+(1-p_{\epsdice{6}})\times p_{\epsdice{6}}\times(1-p_{\epsdice{6}})+(1-p_{\epsdice{6}})\times(1-p_{\epsdice{6}})\times p_{\epsdice{6}}.
\]

\end_inset

We can factor and rearrange to yield:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{one\times\epsdice{6}}=3\times p_{\epsdice{6}}^{1}\left(1-p_{\epsdice{6}}\right)^{2}
\]

\end_inset

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this equation is called the 
\emph on
multiplicity
\emph default
.
 It describes how many different ways we could achieve one 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

—in this case, three.
 We raise 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\epsdice{6}}$
\end_inset

 to the 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{st}$
\end_inset

 power because we see it once, and 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-p_{\epsdice{6}})$
\end_inset

 to the 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{nd}$
\end_inset

 power because we see it twice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This calculation generalizes to:

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(n,k)=\binom{n}{k}p^{k}\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}\label{eq:binomial}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{n}{k}$
\end_inset

 chunk (top row).
 This function is centered at 
\begin_inset Formula $50\%$
\end_inset

, meaning that the the highest number of configurations occurs for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=n/2$
\end_inset

.
 Hopefully this makes intuitive sense.
 (This can be seen graphically in the 
\begin_inset Formula $n-choose-k$
\end_inset

 box above: intermediate values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 maximize the number of ways to arrange the system.) Note also that the peak
 gets 
\emph on
large
\emph default
.
 For the 
\begin_inset Formula $n=300$
\end_inset

 case, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{88}$
\end_inset

 possible arrangments of 
\begin_inset Formula $150$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $150$
\end_inset

 not-
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 dice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$
\end_inset

 chunk (middle row).
 This function decreases exponentially from 
\begin_inset Formula $k=0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=n$
\end_inset

 (note the log scale on the y-axis).
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-p)>p$
\end_inset

 for a fair dice.
 A collection of rolls containing fewer 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 will always be more probable than a collection of rolls with more 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

.
 But, because this function goes as the 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-k)th$
\end_inset

 power, these numbers are even smaller than the 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{n}{k}$
\end_inset

 values are large.
 For the 
\begin_inset Formula $k=150,n=300$
\end_inset

 case 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{n}{k}\approx10^{88}$
\end_inset

, but 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}\approx10^{-129}$
\end_inset

.
 Even the most likely set of rolls—
\begin_inset Formula $k=0$
\end_inset

, containing no 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

—has a very low overall probability (
\begin_inset Formula $1.8\times10^{-24}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you combine 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{n}{k}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$
\end_inset

 (bottom) row, you end up with the total probability of observing 
\begin_inset Formula $P(n,k)$
\end_inset

.
 For clarity, we've put the numerical values of these functions in the table
 below for a few key values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 In the table, one can see that the configuration with the most states from
 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{n}{k}$
\end_inset

 function (
\begin_inset Formula $k=150,n=300$
\end_inset

) is obliterated by the tiny value 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$
\end_inset

 function.
 The highest magnitude for 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$
\end_inset

 function (
\begin_inset Formula $k=0$
\end_inset

), is still tiny.
 Since there is only one way to achieve this outcome—don't roll a single
 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

—its overall probabilty remains very low.
 It's only at 
\begin_inset Formula $k\approx50$
\end_inset

 that these two chunks come together to yield 
\begin_inset Formula $P(n,k)$
\end_inset

 with reasonable probabilities (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.06$
\end_inset

).

Put directly: the equilibrium value for the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 is the result of a balance between 1) the probability of rolling a 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 versus something else (
\begin_inset Formula $p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$
\end_inset

) and 2) tending towards states with maximum multiplicity (
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{n}{k}$
\end_inset

Beginnings of a link to thermodynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fine, you say: what does any of this have to do with thermodynamics? Let's
 make the connection explicit.
 Hopefully, in some chemistry class somewhere, you came across the following:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta S.
\]

\end_inset

You likely remeber that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G$
\end_inset

 (the free energy) indicates whether a reaction is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spontaneous
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or not.
 Maybe 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta H$
\end_inset

 (the change in enthalpy) was described in terms of the difference in the
 energies of bonds formed in the products and reactants.
 Finally, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta S$
\end_inset

 (the change in entropy) might have been explained as a change in the amount
 of disorder between the products and reactants.
 Believe it or not, analogs of these exist even in something as simple as
 the DFR.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To show this, let's calculate the relative probability of being in the in
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $k=k_{2}$
\end_inset

 state versus the 
\begin_inset Formula $k=k_{1}$
\end_inset

 state.
 The ratio of these two probabilities is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{P(n,k_{2})}{P(n,k_{1})}=\text{\ensuremath{\frac{\binom{n}{k_{2}}p^{k_{2}}\left(1-p\right)^{n-k_{2}}}{\binom{n}{k_{1}}p^{k_{1}}(1-p)^{n-k_{1}}}}}
\]

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{n}{k_{1}}$
\end_inset

 notation is a bit unwieldly, so let's replace it with a 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}$
\end_inset

, which will still represent the number of arragements that are possible
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W_{k}=\binom{n}{k}.
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{P(n,k_{2})}{P(n,k_{1})}=\text{\ensuremath{\frac{W_{k_{2}}p^{k_{2}}\left(1-p\right)^{n-k_{2}}}{W_{k_{1}}p^{k_{1}}(1-p)^{n-k_{1}}}}}
\]

\end_inset

To make things simpler, let's take the 
\begin_inset Formula $-ln$
\end_inset

 of both sides.
 (This makes it way easier to deal with a probability like 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-234}$
\end_inset

 because: 
\begin_inset Formula $-ln\left(10^{-234}\right)=234ln(10)=538.8$
\end_inset

.)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-ln\left[\frac{P(n,k_{2})}{P(n,k_{1})}\right]=-ln\left[\text{\ensuremath{\frac{W_{k_{2}}p^{k_{2}}\left(1-p\right)^{n-k_{2}}}{W_{k_{1}}p^{k_{1}}(1-p)^{n-k_{1}}}}}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Because 
\begin_inset Formula $log(a\cdot b)=log(a)+log(b)$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-ln\left[\frac{P(n,k_{2})}{P(n,k_{1})}\right]=-ln\left[\text{\ensuremath{\frac{W_{k_{2}}}{W_{k_{1}}}}}\right]-ln\left[\text{\ensuremath{\frac{p^{k_{2}}\left(1-p\right)^{n-k_{2}}}{p^{k_{1}}(1-p)^{n-k_{1}}}}}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Hopefully this beginning to look an awful lot like things like 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 As formulated by chemists, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta G=-RTln\left(K_{eq}\right)=-RTln\left(\frac{[product]}{[reactant]}\right)
\]

\end_inset

This is directly analogous to:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-ln\left[\frac{P(n,k_{2})}{P(n,k_{1})}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Just like 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G$
\end_inset

, this measures which dice configuration is more probable at equilibrium,
 with a negative value indicating that 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{2}$
\end_inset

 is more favorable than 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 If we put in 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{2}=50$
\end_inset

 (meaning we go from no 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/6$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

), this gives us
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-ln\left[\frac{P(300,50)}{P(300,0)}\right]\approx-33.7
\]

\end_inset

This means that if we started at 
\begin_inset Formula $k=0$
\end_inset

, the system would 
\emph on
spontaneously
\emph default
 go to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=50$
\end_inset

.
 This is exactly the meaning for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G$
\end_inset

 usually given in a chemistry textbook.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This probability is determined by two, offsetting terms.
 The first measures the difference in the number of possible arrangements
 of dice between the 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This is also highly favorable.
 This is because there are many more ways to arrange 
\begin_inset Formula $50$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 than 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-ln\left[\text{\ensuremath{\frac{W_{k_{2}}}{W_{k_{1}}}}}\right]=-ln\left[\text{\ensuremath{\frac{W_{50}}{W_{0}}}}\right]\approx-132.4
\]

\end_inset

This is a change in 
\begin_inset Formula $entropy$
\end_inset

: the system tending towards states with higher multiplicity.

\emph on
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, this tendency towards states of higher multiplicity is opposed
 by the fact that increasing the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 means having less likely rolls: more 
\begin_inset Formula $1/6$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 and fewer 
\begin_inset Formula $5/6$
\end_inset

 not-
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

.
 This is captured in the second term, which quantifies the probability of
 the individual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

microstates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (rolls) that make up each 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 or not-
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

).
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-ln\left[\text{\ensuremath{\frac{p^{k_{2}}\left(1-p\right)^{n-k_{2}}}{p^{k_{1}}(1-p)^{n-k_{1}}}}}\right]=-ln\left[\text{\ensuremath{\frac{p^{50}\left(1-p\right)^{300-50}}{p^{50}(1-p)^{300-0}}}}\right]\approx98.7
\]

\end_inset

This term is positive and 
\emph on
opposes 
\emph default
the entropic drive towards more states.
 This is behaving similarly to an 
\emph on
enthalpy 
\emph default
in this case, where the energy stored in bonds can become less favorable
 in a reaction if there if this is offset by a change in entropy.

Entropy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will now develop an explicit understanding of the microscopic interpretation
 of entropy (
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

).
 In 1948, Claude Shannon introduced a general, probabilistic description
 of entropy.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 It can be interpreted in several ways, but the sense in which we will use
 it will be as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measure of the disorder in a system.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 His equation was:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{shannon}=-\sum_{i}^{W}p_{i}log_{2}\left(p_{i}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the probability of state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is the number of states, and 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is a constant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this form, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 has units of 
\emph on
bits
\emph default
.
 These are the same bits that are used in computer science to measure informatio
n content.
 For example, when you see an Internet connection advertised at 1 gigabit/per
 second, it indicates how quickly information can get from the Internet
 to your computer.
 One way to think about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

disorder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is therefore 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how many bits of information are required to describe the state?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The more disordered a state, the more bits are required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's explore this with some examples.
 Imagine I tell you that I have a fair dice that I am going to roll once.
 There are 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

ways it could come up, each with 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1/6$
\end_inset

.
 According to Shannon, it would take 
\begin_inset Formula $2.58\ bits$
\end_inset

 to communicate the possible outcomes of the roll:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{fair}=-6\times\frac{1}{6}\times log_{2}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)=2.58\ bits
\]

\end_inset

I know something (the roll has can have six possible outcomes, with equal
 probability for each) but the specific face that will show is uncertain.
 I have incomplete information about the state and, thus, non-zero entropy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now imagine that I tell you I have loaded the dice such that it will always
 come up 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

.
 This means that 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1.0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0$
\end_inset

 for other all other faces.
 According to Shannon, I now need 
\begin_inset Formula $0\ bits$
\end_inset

 to communicate the possible outcomes of the roll: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{cheating}=-1.0\times log_{2}\left(1.0\right)=0.00\ bits
\]

\end_inset

Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

 is the only possible outcome, there is no disorder: I do not need any more
 information to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it's going to come up 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We can also go the other way: imagine I have a ten-sided, fair dice.
 In this case: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{10}=-10\times\frac{1}{10}\times log_{2}\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)=3.32\ bits
\]

\end_inset

Because there are more possibilities for a ten-sided dice than a six-sided
 dice, we now need 
\emph on
more 
\emph default
information to describe the system (
\begin_inset Formula $3.32\ bits$
\end_inset

 vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $2.58\ bits$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, to link Shannon's 
\emph on
probabilistic entropy
\emph default
 to the 
\emph on
thermodynamic entropy
\emph default
, physical biochemists use the equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=-R\sum_{i}^{W}p_{i}ln\left(p_{i}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is the gas constant.
 All this does is change the units of entropy from 
\begin_inset Formula $bits$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $kJ\cdot mol^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 We can even convert between them:

Each face of a dice has a charge (
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

).
 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be any number between negative, neutral, or positive.
 Each face has its own charge, but all dice are identical.
 This means that all 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{1}$
\end_inset

 faces on different dice have the same charge.
 All 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{2}$

 faces also have the same charge.
 But the charge on

 need not equal the charge on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The surface on which we roll our dice can also be charged.
 We have a knob we can turn labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

\begin_inset Formula $+\infty$
\end_inset

 (highly positively charged).

 A negatively charged dice face is attracted to the surface, while a positively
 charged dice face is repelled from it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will model the weight on each face as a function of its charge (
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

) and the charge on the surface (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w_{i}=e^{-\beta\times g_{i}}.
\]

\end_inset

Again, looking at the extremes of the function is very helpful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First imagine turning the knob on the surface all the way down to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=0$
\end_inset

, thus turning off the surface charge.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 will equal 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 regardless of the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w_{i}=e^{-0\times g_{i}}=1.
\]

\end_inset

As a result:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{six}=\frac{1}{1+1+1+1+1+1}=\frac{1}{6}.
\]

\end_inset

Hopefully this makes sense.
 We turned off the surface charge, so all faces have equal weight.

 What happens to our dice now? Well, it depends on the charge on the face.
 A negative face will have a very strong attraction to the surface, while
 a positive face will have a very strong repulsion.
 Let's do the calculation for some arbitrary charge values: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{1}=0,g_{2}=0,g_{3}=0,g_{4}=0,g_{5}=0,g_{6}=-2
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{six}=\frac{e^{--2\times11}}{e^{-0\times11}+e^{-0\times11}+e^{-0\times11}+e^{0\times11}+e^{-0\times11}+e^{--2\times11}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{six}=\frac{358,491,284}{1+1+1+1+1+358,491,284}\approx1.0
\]

\end_inset

Under this scenario, we now very strongly favor showing 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsdice{6}$

The first law of thermodynamics says that we can't make a perfectly efficient
 machine, no matter how hard we try.
 If we do any interersting work, we 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G=H-TS
\]

\end_inset

We will start with an arbitrary word: 
\emph on
enthalpy.
 
\emph default
We will declare it, by fiat, to be the sum of the 
\emph on
internal energy
\emph default
 of the system (
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

) and the pressure times the volume (
\begin_inset Formula $PV$
\end_inset

).
 The internal energy is (basically) just the sum of all of the energies
 of the bonds formed.
 The pressure times the volume is, well, the pressure times the volume.
 Here's our definition of enthalpy.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=U+PV
\]

\end_inset

We rarely care about the absolute enthalpy of a system, but rather the change
 in the enthalpy when a reaction occurs.
 So, for the reaction:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
reactants\rightarrow products
\]

\end_inset

 we would write:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta H=H_{products}-H_{reactants}.
\]

\end_inset

With some intriguing exceptions, most of biology occurs at constant pressure
 and volume.
 This means that we can assume the pressure and volume are tthe same after
 a reaction, meaning:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta H\approx U_{products}+\cancel{PV_{products}}-U_{reactants}-\cancel{PV_{reactants}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta H=U_{products}-U_{reactants}=\Delta U.
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The change in the internal energy of a system (
\begin_inset Formula $dU$
\end_inset

) is given by the change in the 
\emph on
heat 
\emph default
(
\begin_inset Formula $dq$
\end_inset

) and the the work done (
\begin_inset Formula $dw$
\end_inset

).
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dU=dq+dw
\]

\end_inset

For a unimolecular interaction—like a protein unfolding—the only work that
 could be done would be piston-like work (e.g.
 expanding the volume of the solution, or changing the pressure of a sealed
 vessel).
 For the vast majority of biochemical reactions, however, the pressure and
 volume are essentially constant.
 This means that 
\begin_inset Formula $dw\approx0$
\end_inset

.
 (This is not 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 true, but it will be for the systems we study in this class).
 So:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dU=dq+\cancel{dw}
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q=C\Delta T
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{V}=\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{V}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=U+pV
\]

\end_inset

In biological systems, we will assume 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 are essentially constant.
