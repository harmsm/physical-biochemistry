#### Content organization
+ *docs*: Slides shown in class.  These are designed for use with   
  [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).  (They are called "docs"
  rather than "slides" so they can be accssed directly via github. The slides can
  be viewed as slides at https://harmsm.github.io/physical-biochemistry/).
+ *homework*: Homework for the course.
+ *labs*: Interactive exercises, done in class, designed to develop specific skills.
  These are expected to take about 2 hr of class time.
+ *notes*: Notes used by the instructor in teaching the class.  Not necessarily
